Microsoft created the contemporary, object-oriented programming language C#. It is a component of the.NET framework and is used to create a wide range of applications, including websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, cloud-based services, and games. In terms of popularity, C# is now ranked fifth worldwide by the Tiobe Index. It placed eighth in the 2021 Stack Overflow developer survey for most popular programming languages, which is conducted annually. After some investigation and considering my prior knowledge, the features such as readability, in-demand skill, constantly developing, large community, object-oriented and potent development tools are what convinced me to choose C#.
