<h1>Get Set Go</h1>
<p>
Since my bachelor's, javaTpoint has been my go-to website for learning a new language or technology. I used it to begin learning C#. I started by just going over some of the C# features, like syntax, keywords, control statements, arrays, strings, and object-oriented programming. Later, from this link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet , I downloaded the.NET 6.0 SDK (v6.0.405).
</p>
<p>
Since C# is inextricably linked to the .NET framework and cannot work on C# without it. To work with C#, we must download .NET. In accordance with best practices, I downloaded the Long Term Support (LTS) version. I followed convention and created my first Hello World application in C#. I was told that there are four different ways to write the Hello World program when I referred javaTpoint. In this case, they just modified the access modifier and used the system, which I felt was unnecessary to try different techniques.
</p>
<p>
I have used terminal to compile and run the code. It is a little annoying that I must set path variables and type commands to run the file. Initially, I forgot to give path variables and received error.
</p>

<p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red;">'csc' is not recognized as an internal or external command</p>

<p>
However, working on a terminal is a good practice. Once, after writing the program in visual studio code. Type csc filename.cs and hit Enter to build. MyFirstCsharpProgram is the name of our file in this case, thus we will write csc MyFirstCsharpProgram.cs. Once the program has been compiled, type filename and hit enter to launch it. We will receive the output.
</p>
<p>
I've also created another program that employs the if else statement to determine whether a number is even or odd.
</p>
<b><h3>Summary</h3></b>
<p>
I had a good start to learn C# using javaTpoint. I have spent time, on initial setup and learning features, syntax, keywords and control statements.
