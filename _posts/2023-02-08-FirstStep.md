<h1><b>First Step</b></h1>
<p>
  After a good start in learning C# programming language. I referred to various syntaxes and keywords in the C# to proceed further. When I finished writing my first blog last week, I used <code>System.Console.WriteLine("");</code>Â to print to the console, but I subsequently found that we can also execute Console operations in C# by <code>using System;</code>. There is no need to write System to print on console if we use the <code>using System;</code> library in our project. It can be expressed as <code>Console.WriteLine("");</code>.
<p>
  I first had problems understanding how C# processes user input. The user input statement in C# differs significantly from those in other languages I've worked on. 
Confusion arises when using <code>Console.ReadLine();</code> to accept user input in C# when you need to use <code>Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());</code> instead. 
Since the string returned by <code>Console.ReadLine();</code>. I attempted to convert the user input to an integer using the syntax <code>int n = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());</code> but was unsuccessful. The error message read, <code>" Cannot indirectly convert type 'string' to 'int'. "</code>. It took me some time to realize this. 
</p>

  Later, I decided to learn C# control statements. Every programming language needs control statements, and C# is no exception. Based on specific conditions, that are used to regulate how a program is executed. I worked on various control statements in C# such as <a href="https://github.com/rugveth1210/Language-Learning-Blog/blob/main/_Codes/IfElseCsharp.cs">If Else Statement</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rugveth1210/Language-Learning-Blog/blob/main/_Codes/WhileLoop.cs">While Loop</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rugveth1210/Language-Learning-Blog/blob/main/_Codes/SwitchCase.cs">Switch Case</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rugveth1210/Language-Learning-Blog/blob/main/_Codes/ForLoop.cs">For Loop</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rugveth1210/Language-Learning-Blog/blob/main/_Codes/DoWhileLoop.cs">Do While Loop</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rugveth1210/Language-Learning-Blog/blob/main/_Codes/BreakStatement.cs">Break Statement</a>. 
</p>
<h2><b>Summary</b></h2>
<p>
  Despite the challenges, I had when learning C#. I thought my learning of C# had advanced well at this point. To study C# successfully, I'm creating a road map. I currently learn about control statements, keywords, and syntax.
