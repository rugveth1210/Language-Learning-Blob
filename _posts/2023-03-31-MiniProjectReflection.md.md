<p align="justify">We worked on a mini C# project this week. <b> The creation of a project is a little challenging because .NET framework is new to all of us. </b> We 
  made the decision to develop a weather app that shows weather based on the zip code and city that the user has chosen using .NET framework. The application's primary 
  objective is to retrieve weather data from openweathermap.org's 
  API based on user-entered ZIP code and display it in a user-friendly format. While working on this project we gained knowledge of C# programming language, 
  Windows Forms, and .NET framework would be essential to develop the Weather application. 
</p>
  
<p align="justify">
  Additionally, we learnt skills like API integration, data retrieval, and 
  parsing the data in C#. To complete the project, we had read the documentation to have better understanding on the structure of the openweathermap.org's API, handling 
  user input, designing and omplementing a GUI, and packaging the application as a windows executable.
</p>

<p align="justify"> <b>The most significant challenges we faced during the development of this application could be handling unexpected errors, user inputs, and the 
  overall functionality of the application. Moreover, parsing the retrieved data and presenting it in a user-friendly manner could be a challenging task. Furthermore, we 
  faced challenges while working on integration of the project using the GitHub.</b> 
  However, overcoming 
  these challenges will provide a sense of accomplishment and an opportunity to learn new skills and enhance existing ones.
</p>
<p align="justify">In conclusion, the C# Mini-Project we worked on provides a hands-on learning opportunity to apply previously acquired skills in C# programming 
  language, Windows Forms, and .NET 
framework. The project's simplicity allows for easy task breakdown, and overcoming the project's challenges had enhanced our skills in API integration, data retrieval, 
parsing, and GUI design.
