<h1><b>Second Step</b></h1>
<p align="justify">
  This week, I focused my learning on 'Functions' and 'Arrays' in C#. Functions play a crucial role in programming. A function is block of code which execute statements specified inside it. 
  The execution of the function happens by calling the function. It is simpler to read and maintain code when huge applications are divided into smaller, 
  more manageable portions using functions. Additionally, by reusing functions across the entire application, it will save time and length of the code. 
  A function can be invoked from other areas of the program once it has been defined.
  I intially learnt about the syntax of the function in C#.
  <code>
    <access-specifier> <return-type> NameoftheFunction(<parameters>)  
    {  
      // body of the function  
      // return statement  
    }  
  </code>
  The syntax of the functions in C# is similar to various Object-Oriented Programing Languages such as Java, C++, etc. Due to this I was able to understand 
  functions quickly in C#. As I understood the functions quickly in C#. I made an attempt to create a program to show invoking the function. 
  This <a href="https://github.com/rugveth1210/Language-Learning-Blog/blob/main/_Codes/FunctionCallByValue.cs">Call By Value</a> demonstrate calling 
  the function.

  Furthermore, I worked on arrays in C# this week. As someone who learned to program, I remember being fascinated by the concept of arrays. 
  An array in C# is a group of values that are all kept in the same variable. 
  The array's values can be accessed and changed using loops and other programming techniques since each value in the array has a distinct index number.
  Intially, I found the syntax a little bit challenging to understand in C#. It is quite different from the programming languages I worked on. 
  While, I was trying to write code on my own in arrays, I was making mistakes based on syntax. Apart from this, I wasted lot of time for taking elements from the user.
  I had difficulty in taking user input using <code>Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine())</code>. 
  Finally, I had written a <a href="https://github.com/rugveth1210/Language-Learning-Blog/blob/main/_Codes/Arrays.cs">Arrays</a> program to take elements from the user 
  and store it in an array.

<h2><b>Summary</b></h2>
<p align="justify">
  Overall, I found that learning about arrays and functions was an interesting and worthwhile experience. In C# programming, functions and arrays are crucial.
  Eventhough, I am getting frustrated with syntaxes in C#, learning C# has huge benefits.
